This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Original Artwork

This portfolio features custom animated SVG artwork that was created specifically for this project. All character illustrations and interactive elements are original designs:

### Animated Characters

- **StickFigure** - An animated stick figure character that floats on a decorative island. Features eye-tracking that follows your cursor and a waving animation when you hover or click. Includes a thought bubble with rotating developer-themed messages.

- **ConfusedStickFigure** - A confused variant of the stick figure used on the 404 error page. Features a searching animation, tilted head, scratching gesture, and a cracked floating island with a "404" signpost.

- **ThoughtBubble** - An animated thought bubble component that displays rotating messages with smooth fade transitions.

### Interactive Elements

- **PuzzleHeart** - A unique like button design featuring a heart shape divided into 8 interlocking puzzle pieces. As users like content, the pieces progressively fill in with a gradient effect, and the heart pulses when complete.

All original artwork is covered under the MIT license. See [CREDITS.md](./CREDITS.md) for full attribution details.
